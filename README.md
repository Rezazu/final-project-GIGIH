# Rails on Replit

This is a template to get you started with Rails on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

This template was generated using `rails new` (after you install the `rails` gem from the packager sidebar) so you can always do that if you prefer to set it up from scratch. The only had two make config changes we had to make to run it on Replit:

- bind the app on `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost` (see `.replit`)
- allow `*.repl.co` hosts (see `config/environments/development.rb`)
- allow the app to be iframed on `replit.com` (see `config/application.rb`)

## Running the app

Simple hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Running commands

Start every command with `bundle exec` so that it runs in the context of the installed gems environment. The console pane will give you output from the server but you can run arbitrary command from the shell without stopping the server.

## Database

SQLite would work in development but we don't recommend running it in production. Instead look into using the built-in [Replit database](http://docs.replit.com/misc/database). Otherwise you are welcome to connect databases from your favorite provider.

### Disclaimer
I Only finishedd about 70% of the user story. I finished CRUD session on Food model, also with the price>0.01, description.length<150 validation. I Make the main page only showed the menu and you need to open modal to access the database.

As for the orders, I'm still confused on how im gonna make orders table work with order_details. So all i did is finished orders table (with validation) which are not connected to order_details table. It made orders table unable to process total_price thus return it empty.
